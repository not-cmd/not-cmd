### 🚀 Featured Projects

<!-- Replace these with your actual project names and descriptions -->
- [Project 1](https://github.com/not-cmd/Cancer-Gene-Dependency): _Project Brief: Cancer Gene Dependency Prediction with Multi-modal Graph Neural Networks

Core Objective: Predict essential cancer genes by modeling complex relationships between cell lines and their multi-omics profiles using advanced graph neural networks.

🧬 What It Does

Builds a heterogeneous graph connecting cancer cell lines and genes through three biological relationships: mutations, copy number alterations, and gene expression
Uses Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) to learn from this multi-modal data
Predicts gene dependency scores - measuring how essential each gene is for cancer cell survival
🔑 Key Innovations

Novel Graph Structure: Models biological data as an interconnected network rather than separate datasets
Multi-modal Integration: Combines mutation, copy number, and expression data in one unified framework
State-of-the-Art ML: Implements cutting-edge HGT architecture with attention mechanisms
Therapeutic Relevance: Directly identifies potential drug targets for cancer treatment
📊 Technical Highlights

Processes 6.6GB DepMap dataset - gold standard in cancer genomics
Creates 3D visualizations of learned cell line embeddings colored by cancer type
Benchmarks against traditional methods for high-accuracy predictions
Provides model interpretability through attention weights
🎯 Impact & Applications

Drug Discovery: Identifies vulnerable genes for targeted cancer therapies
Personalized Medicine: Predicts gene dependencies across different cancer types
Research Tool: Provides insights into cancer biology through learned embeddings

- [Project 2](https://github.com/not-cmd/busface): _Project Brief: GuardianRoute

GuardianRoute is an AI-driven school transportation safety platform designed to protect students during their daily commute. It provides real-time tracking, automated attendance, and seamless communication among administrators, bus staff, and parents—creating a transparent and secure school transport ecosystem.

⸻

Key Features
	1.	AI-Powered Attendance & Intruder Detection
Uses computer vision and Gemini-based AI models to automatically recognize students, mark attendance, and detect intruders or wrong bus boardings in real time via live camera feeds.
	2.	Live Bus Tracking
Integrates GPS through Firebase Realtime Database and Mapbox to provide continuous updates on bus locations, enabling instant visibility for admins and parents.
	3.	AI Insights & Safety Analytics
Employs Genkit to generate natural-language attendance summaries and driver safety scores based on behavioral data like speeding or braking patterns.
	4.	Smart Chatbot & Messaging System
Offers parents an AI-powered chatbot for common queries and a live chat channel with admins, ensuring timely communication and support.
	5.	Emergency & Alert System
Includes panic and automated alert mechanisms that instantly notify admins and parents of emergencies, speeding, or unauthorized activity.

⸻

Technology Stack
	•	Frontend: Next.js (React + TypeScript)
	•	UI: ShadCN UI + Tailwind CSS
	•	Backend & Real-Time Sync: Firebase Realtime Database
	•	AI Engine: Google Genkit with Gemini models
	•	Mapping: Mapbox
	•	Deployment: Firebase App Hosting

⸻

Summary

GuardianRoute combines real-time data, AI-based vision systems, and generative intelligence to redefine school commute safety. It transforms traditional bus monitoring into an intelligent, proactive, and collaborative system that enhances trust, accountability, and student protection._

- [Project 3](https://github.com/not-cmd/ExpenseTracker): _This Kotlin-based Android application is built using Gradle for efficient project management and build automation. The app structure follows modern Android development practices, enabling fast, reliable, and incremental builds. With optimized Gradle tasks and dependency handling, the project ensures smooth development, quick iteration, and maintainable code.._
